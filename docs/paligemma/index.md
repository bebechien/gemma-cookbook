# PaliGemma

PaliGemma 2 and PaliGemma are lightweight open *vision-language models* (VLM)
inspired by [PaLI-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199),
and based on open components like the [SigLIP
vision model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343) and the [Gemma language
model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08295). PaliGemma takes both images and text as inputs and can answer questions about
images with detail and context, meaning that PaliGemma can perform deeper analysis of
images and provide useful insights, such as captioning for images and short videos,
object detection, and reading text embedded within images.

PaliGemma 2 is available in 3B, 10B, and 28B parameter sizes, which are based on Gemma 2
2B, 9B, and 27B models, respectively. The original PaliGemma models are available in the
3B size. For more information on Gemma model variants, see the
[Gemma models list](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/get_started#models-list).
PaliGemma model variants support different pixel resolutions for image inputs, including
224 x 224, 448 x 448, and 896 x 896 pixels.

You can view and download PaliGemma models from the follow sites:

- Download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models?query=paligemma).
- Download from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?search=google/paligemma).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** **Pretrained** PaliGemma models *require* tuning in order to produce useful results. Make sure you perform fine-tuning on these PaliGemma models and test the output *before* deploying them to end users.

There are three categories of PaliGemma models:

- **PaliGemma PT** - General purpose pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned on a variety of tasks.
- **PaliGemma FT** - Research-oriented models that are fine-tuned on specific research datasets.
- **PaliGemma mix** - Models tuned to a mixture of tasks that can be used out-of-the-box for common use cases.

Key benefits include:

## Multimodal capability

Simultaneously handles both images and text input.

## Versatile base model

Can be fine-tuned on a wide range of vision-language tasks.

## Off-the-shelf exploration

Comes with a checkpoint fine-tuned on a mixture of tasks for immediate research use.
