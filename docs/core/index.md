:::

Gemma is a family of generative artificial intelligence models and you can
use them in a wide variety of generation tasks, including question answering,
summarization, and reasoning. Gemma models are provided with open weights and
permit responsible
[commercial use](/terms),
allowing you to tune and deploy them in your own projects and applications.

Gemma 4 model family spans four distinct architectures tailored for specific
hardware requirements:

-   **Small Sizes:** 2B and 4B effective parameter models built for
    ultra-mobile, edge, and browser deployment (e.g., Pixel, Chrome).
-   **Dense:** A powerful 31B parameter dense model that bridges the gap between
    server-grade performance and local execution.
-   **Mixture-of-Experts:** A highly efficient 26B MoE model designed for
    high-throughput, advanced reasoning.
-   **Unified:** A 12B parameter encoder free model for multimodal tasks,
    replaced vision and audio encoders with direct linear projections of the
    input.

You can download Gemma 4 models from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models?query=gemma-4&publisher=google) and

## Capabilities

-   **Reasoning:** All models in the family are designed as highly capable
    reasoners, with configurable [thinking
    modes](/gemma/docs/capabilities/thinking).
-   **Extended Multimodalities:** Processes Text,
    [Image](/capabilities/vision/image) with variable aspect ratio
    and resolution support (all models),
    [Video](/capabilities/vision/video), and
    [Audio](/capabilities/audio) (featured natively on the E2B, E4B
    and 12B models).
-   **Increased Context Window:** Small models feature a 128K context window,
    while the medium models support 256K.
-   **Enhanced Coding & Agentic Capabilities:** Achieves notable improvements in
    coding benchmarks alongside built-in [function-calling
    support](/gemma/docs/capabilities/text/function-calling-gemma4), powering
    highly capable autonomous agents.
-   **Native System Prompt Support:** Gemma 4 introduces built-in support for
    the system role, enabling more structured and controllable conversations.
-   **[Multi-Token Prediction](/mtp/overview):** All Gemma 4 models
    (E2B, E4B, 12B, 31B, and 26B A4B) include a dedicated draft model for
    speculative decoding, enabling significantly faster inference with no
    quality loss.

## Parameter sizes and quantization

Gemma 4 models are available in 5 parameter sizes: E2B, E4B, 12B, 31B and 26B
A4B. The models can be used with their default precision (16-bit) or with a
lower precision using quantization. The different sizes and precisions represent
a set of trade-offs for your AI application. Models with higher parameters and
bit counts (higher precision) are generally more capable, but are more expensive
to run in terms of processing cycles, memory cost and power consumption. Models
with lower parameters and bit counts (lower precision) have less capabilities,
but may be sufficient for your AI task.

### Gemma 4 Inference Memory Requirements

The following table details the approximate GPU or TPU memory requirements for
running inference with each size of the Gemma 4 model versions.

Note: These numbers may change based on your specific inference tool and
environment.

| Parameters | BF16 (16-bit) | SFP8 (8-bit) | Q4_0 (4-bit) | Mobile | Mobile (Text-only) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gemma 4 E2B | 11.4 GB | 5.7 GB | 2.9 GB | 1.1 GB | 0.84 GB |
| Gemma 4 E4B | 17.9 GB | 8.9 GB | 4.5 GB | 2.5 GB | 2.2 GB |
| Gemma 4 12B | 26.7 GB | 13.4 GB | 6.7 GB | - | - |
| Gemma 4 26B A4B | 57.7 GB | 28.8 GB | 14.4 GB | - | - |
| Gemma 4 31B | 69.9 GB | 34.9 GB | 17.5 GB | - | - |

**Table 1.** Approximate GPU or TPU memory required to load Gemma 4 models based
on parameter count, quantization level and 20% overhead of loading additional
things. Mobile versions use LiteRT-LM.

### Key Considerations for Memory Planning

*   **Efficient Architecture (E2B and E4B):** The "E" stands for "effective"
    parameters. The smaller models incorporate Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE) to
    maximize parameter efficiency in on-device deployments. Rather than adding
    more layers to the model, PLE gives each decoder layer its own small
    embedding for every token. These embedding tables are large but only used
    for quick lookups, which is why the total memory required to load static
    weights is higher than the effective parameter count suggests.
*   **The MoE Architecture (26B A4B):** The 26B is a Mixture of Experts
    model. While it only activates 4 billion parameters per token during
    generation, **all 26 billion parameters** must be loaded into memory to
    maintain fast routing and inference speeds. This is why its baseline memory
    requirement is much closer to a dense 26B model than a 4B model.
*   **Base Weights Only:** The estimates in the preceding table *only* account
    for the memory required to load the static model weights. They don't include
    the additional VRAM needed for supporting software or the context window.
*   **Context Window (KV Cache):** Memory consumption will increase dynamically
    based on the total number of tokens in your prompt and the generated
    response. Larger context windows require significantly more VRAM on top of
    the base model weights.
*   **Fine-Tuning Overhead:** Memory requirements for *fine-tuning* Gemma models
    are drastically higher than for standard inference. Your exact footprint
    will depend heavily on the development framework, batch size, and whether
    you are using full-precision tuning versus a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
    (PEFT) method like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

For deployments requiring maximum efficiency with minimal quality compromise,
Gemma offers official **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** models.

Unlike standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which compresses a fully
trained model and can lead to quality degradation, QAT integrates quantization
simulation into the training process itself. This allows the model to learn to
compensate for the precision loss, resulting in smaller models that perform
nearly identically to their high-precision baselines.
