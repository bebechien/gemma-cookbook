# FunctionGemma formatting and best practices

FunctionGemma is a specialized version of the Gemma 3 270M model,
trained specifically for **function calling** (i.e., tool use).

To manage the interaction between natural language instructions and structured,
tool-related data, FunctionGemma uses a specific set of formatting control
tokens. These tokens are essential for the model to distinguish between
conversation and data, and to understand tool definitions, tool calls, and tool
results.

## Base Prompt Structure

FunctionGemma builds on the [Gemma prompt structure][1], using
`<start_of_turn>role` and `<end_of_turn>` to describe conversational turns.
The `role` is typically `user` or `model` (and sometimes `developer` for
providing initial context, as seen below).

The function-specific tokens are used *within* these turns to structure the
tool-related information.

### Control Tokens

FunctionGemma is trained on six special tokens to manage the "tool use"
lifecycle.

| Token Pair | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<start_function_declaration>` <br> `<end_function_declaration>` | Defines a tool. |
| `<start_function_call>` <br> `<end_function_call>` | Indicates a model's request to use a tool. |
| `<start_function_response>` <br> `<end_function_response>` | Provides a tool's result back to the model. |

> NOTE: `<start_function_response>` is an additional stop sequence for the
inference engine.

### Delimiter for String Values: `<escape>`

A single token, `<escape>`, is used as a delimiter for **all string values**
within the structured data blocks.

*   **Purpose:** This token ensures that any special characters (like `{`, `}`,
    `,`, or quotes) inside a string are treated as literal text and not as part
    of the data structure's syntax.
*   **Usage:** All string literals in your function declarations, calls, and
    responses must be enclosed, like: `key:<escape>string value<escape>`.

## Training Scope and Limitations

FunctionGemma is trained for specific types of agentic workflows. It is
important to understand the model's training context to ensure reliability in
production environments.

### Supported Workflows

The model has been explicitly trained on **Single Turn** and **Parallel**
function calling.

*   **Single Turn:** The user provides a query, and the model selects a single
    tool to address it.
*   **Parallel:** The user provides a query containing multiple independent
    requests, and the model generates multiple tool calls simultaneously.

**Example: Parallel (Supported)**

> **User:** "What is the weather in Tokyo and what is the stock price of Google?"

The model generates calls for `get_weather(Tokyo)` and
`get_stock_price(GOOG)` in a single response. These actions don't depend on
each other.

### Unsupported Workflows

The model has **not** been explicitly trained on **Multi-Turn** or
**Multi-Step** workflows.

> **Note:** We expect the model to be able to generalize a bit to these
> scenarios, especially if fine-tuned on specific use cases, but it has not been
> trained to perform these tasks out of the box.

*   **Multi-Step (Chaining):** Scenarios where the output of one tool is
    required as the argument for a subsequent tool.
    *   **Example:** "Roll a die with 20 sides and check if the number is
        prime."
    *   **Complexity:** This requires rolling a die first (Tool A), and
        *then* using the result to check if the number is prime (Tool B).
        FunctionGemma is not trained to reason through this dependency chain
        automatically.

*   **Multi-Turn:** Scenarios requiring the model to maintain state or context
    over a long back-and-forth conversation to determine tool parameters.

> **User:** "Book me a table."<br>
> **Model:** "For how many people?"<br>
> **User:** "Four."

*   **Complexity:** The model is not explicitly trained to aggregate these
    separate turns into a final `book_table(people=4)` call without external
    state management.

### Semantic Nuances

The model may sometimes miss the relationship between semantically related
concepts if the user's prompt is abstract or indirect.

Here's an example function.

```python
def get_current_temperature(location: str, unit: str):
    """
    Get the current temperature at a location.

    Args:
        location: The location to get the temperature for.
        unit: The unit to return the temperature in. (choices: ["celsius", "fahrenheit"])
    """
    return 22.0
```

For example, concepts like "cold" or "hot" imply temperature, but might not
immediately trigger a specific tool named `get_current_temperature` if the model
does not make the semantic connection in that specific context.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enriched Tool Definition:** This is often the most effective fix.
        Expanding the function's description to include semantic keywords helps
        the model bridge the gap. For example, adding "This function can be used
        to determine if the weather is hot or cold in a given location" to the
        docstring allows FunctionGemma to correctly map those qualitative
        descriptors to the tool.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Making the user query more detailed or explicit
        can help the model trigger the correct tool, though this relies on user
        behavior.
    *   **Fine-tuning:** For production environments where users frequently use
        highly indirect language (e.g., "is it nice out?" versus "get weather"),
        we recommend [fine-tuning][3] the model on a dataset that explicitly
        maps these semantic nuances to the correct tool definitions.

**Example: Make Semantic Connection**

> **User:** "Hey, is it cold in Paris right now?"

**Scenario A: Limited Description** If the tool description is just `Get the
current temperature at a location.`, the model might fail to associate "cold"
with get_current_temperature and respond that it cannot provide weather
information.

**Scenario B: Enriched Description** If the tool description is updated to
include: `Get the current temperature at a location. This function can be used
to determine if the weather is hot or cold in a given location.`, the model
successfully makes the connection:<br>
`<start_function_call>call:get_current_temperature{location:<escape>Paris<escape>,unit:<escape>celsius<escape>}<end_function_call>`

## Example: Weather Tool Flow

Here is a complete, step-by-step formatted example demonstrating the flow for
using the `get_current_weather` tool.

### Turn 1: Tool Definition (Developer)

First, you provide the model with the definitions of all available tools. This
is done as the first turn from a `developer` role. This block is used to provide
the model with the "schema" of an available function, including its name, a
description of what it does, and its parameters.

It is important to include the system prompt `You are a model that can do
function calling with the following functions` to enable the model to call
tools. This phrase acts as a prompt-based trigger to switch between tooling
capability and general conversation.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
&lt;start_of_turn>developer
You are a model that can do function calling with the following functions&lt;start_function_declaration>declaration:get_current_weather{description:&lt;escape>Gets the current weather in a given location.&lt;escape>,parameters:{properties:{location:{description:&lt;escape>The city and state, e.g. "San Francisco, CA" or "Tokyo, JP"&lt;escape>,type:&lt;escape>STRING&lt;escape>},unit:{description:&lt;escape>The unit to return the temperature in.&lt;escape>,enum:[&lt;escape>celsius&lt;escape>,&lt;escape>fahrenheit&lt;escape>],type:&lt;escape>STRING&lt;escape>}},required:[&lt;escape>location&lt;escape>],type:&lt;escape>OBJECT&lt;escape>}}&lt;end_function_declaration>&lt;end_of_turn>
</pre>

### Turn 2: User Prompt (User)

Next, the user asks a question that requires the tool you just defined.

```none
<start_of_turn>user
Hey, what's the weather in Tokyo right now?<end_of_turn>
```

### Turn 3: Model Issues Function Call (Model)

The model processes the user's request and the tool definition. It determines it
needs to call the `get_current_weather` function and outputs the following turn.

```none
<start_function_call>call:get_current_weather{location:<escape>Tokyo, Japan<escape>}<end_function_call>
```

> **Application Logic:** At this point, your application must intercept this output. Instead of displaying it to the user, you parse the function call (e.g., `get_current_weather(location="Tokyo, Japan")`), execute this function in your own code, and get the result (e.g., a JSON object).

### Turn 4: Application Provides Function Response (Developer)

You now send the return value from your function back to the model. This turn
uses the function response tokens.

```none
<start_function_response>response:get_current_weather{temperature:15,weather:<escape>sunny<escape>}<end_function_response>
```

### Turn 5: Model Generates Final Answer (Model)

The model receives the function's result from Turn 4. It now has all the
information needed to answer the user's original question from Turn 2. It
processes this new context and generates the final, natural language response.

```none
The current weather in Tokyo is sunny with a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius.<end_of_turn>
```
