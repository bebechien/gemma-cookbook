## Model Information

ShieldGemma 2 is a model trained on Gemma 3's 4B IT checkpoint for image safety
classification across key categories that takes in images and outputs safety
labels per policy.

### Description

ShieldGemma 2, built on Gemma 3, is a 4 billion (4B) parameter model that checks
the safety of both synthetic and natural images against key categories to help
you build robust datasets and models. With this addition to the Gemma family of
models, researchers and developers can now minimize the risk of harmful content
affecting their Generative-AI powered applications across key
[harm types](shieldgemma/model_card_2#guidelines-to-use-in-prompts).

We recommend using ShieldGemma 2 as an input filter to vision language models,
or as an output filter of image generation systems. To train a robust image
safety model, we curated training datasets of natural and synthetic images and
instruction-tuned Gemma 3 to demonstrate strong performance. We compared safety
policies to different benchmarks, and are releasing a technical report that
incorporates third party benchmarks.

### Inputs and outputs

*   **Input:** Image and prompt instruction with policy definition.
*   **Output:** Probability of 'Yes' or 'No' tokens. A higher score for the
    'Yes' token indicates that the model is confident that the content violates
    the included policy. The inverse is true for the 'No' token. Both scores are
    provided to enable classification metrics and calibration.

#### Guidelines to use in prompts

Here is our prompt instruction `[Prompt Instruction]`:

```none
You are a policy expert trying to help determine whether a generated or real
image is in violation of the safety policy below. Your decision must very
clearly follow the specific language used in the safety policy and should not
include any interpretation outside of the safety policy.

<BEGIN_SAFETY_POLICY>
{policy}
</END_SAFETY_POLICY>

Does the image violate the above policy? Your Answer must start with 'Yes' or 'No'.
```
**Use Case: Image Classification**

| Harm Type                 | Guideline                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Sexually Explicit content | "No Sexually Explicit content": The image shall  |
:                           : not contain content that depicts explicit or     :
:                           : graphic sexual acts (e.g., pornography, erotic.  :
:                           : nudity, depictions of rape or sexual assault).   :
| Dangerous content         | "No Dangerous content": The image shall not      |
:                           : contain content that facilitates or encourages   :
:                           : activities that could cause real-world harm      :
:                           : (e.g., building firearms and explosive devices,  :
:                           : promotion of terrorism, instructions for         :
:                           : suicide).                                        :
| Violent content           | "No Violence/Gore content": The image shall not  |
:                           : contain content that depicts shocking,           :
:                           : sensational, or gratuitous violence (e.g.,       :
:                           : excessive blood and gore, gratuitous violence    :
:                           : against animals, extreme injury or moment of     :
:                           : death).                                          :

## Model Data

Data used for model training and how the data was processed.

### Training Dataset

Our training dataset consists of both natural images and synthetic images. For
natural images, we sample a subset of images from WebLI (Web Language and Image)
dataset that are relevant to the safety tasks. For synthetic images, we use an
internal data generation pipeline to enable controlled generation of prompts and
corresponding images that balance the diversity and severity of images. For this
study, harm types were limited to dangerous, sexually explicit, and violent
content, with English only. Additional adversarial and sub-topics were
structured using a taxonomy that corresponds to respective policies, and a range
of demographics, context, and regional aspects.

## Data Preprocessing

Here are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training
data: CSAM Filtering: CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering was applied
in the data preparation process to ensure the exclusion of illegal content.

## Implementation Information

### Hardware

ShieldGemma 2 was trained using the latest generation of
[Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)][tpu] hardware (TPUv5e), for more details refer to
the [Gemma 3 model card][gemma3-model-card].

### Software

Training was done using [JAX][jax] and [ML Pathways][ml-pathways]. For more
details refer to the [Gemma 3 model card][gemma3-model-card].

## Evaluation

### Benchmark Results

ShieldGemma 2 4B was evaluated against internal and external datasets. Our
internal dataset is synthetically generated through our internal image data
curation pipeline. This pipeline includes key steps such as problem definition,
safety taxonomy generation, image query generation, image generation, attribute
analysis, label quality validation, and more. We have approximately 500 examples
for each harm policy. The positive ratios are 39%, 67%, 32% for sexual,
dangerous content, violence respectively. We will also be releasing a technical
report that includes evaluations against external datasets.

**Internal Benchmark Evaluation Results**

| Model                  | Sexually Explicit | Dangerous Content | Violence & Gore |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| LlavaGuard 7B          | 47.6/93.1/63.0    | 67.8/47.2/55.7    | 36.8/100.0/53.8 |
| GPT-4o mini            | 68.3/97.7/80.3    | 84.4/99.0/91.0    | 40.2/100.0/57.3 |
| Gemma-3-4B-IT          | 77.7/87.9/82.5    | 75.9/94.5/84.2    | 78.2/82.2/80.1  |
| ShieldGemma-2-Image-4B | 87.6/89.7/88.6    | 95.6/91.9/93.7    | 80.3/90.4/85.0  |

## Ethics and Safety

### Evaluation Approach

Although the ShieldGemma models are generative models, they are designed to be
run in *scoring mode* to predict the probability that the next token would `Yes`
or `No`. Therefore, safety evaluation focused primarily on outputting effective
image safety labels.

### Evaluation Results

These models were assessed for ethics, safety, and fairness considerations and
met internal guidelines. When compared with benchmarks, evaluation datasets were
iterated on and balanced against diverse taxonomies. Image safety labels were
also human-labelled and checked for use cases that eluded the model, enabling us
to improve upon rounds of evaluation.

## Usage and Limitations

These models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.

### Intended Usage

ShieldGemma 2 is intended to be used as a safety content moderator, either for
human user inputs, model outputs, or both. These models are part of the
[Responsible Generative AI Toolkit][rai-toolkit], which is a set of
recommendations, tools, datasets and models aimed to improve the safety of AI
applications as part of the Gemma ecosystem.

### Limitations

All the usual limitations for large language models apply, see the
[Gemma 3 model card][gemma3-model-card] for more details. Additionally,
there are limited benchmarks that can be used to evaluate content moderation so
the training and evaluation data might not be representative of real-world
scenarios.

ShieldGemma 2 is also highly sensitive to the specific user-provided description
of safety principles, and might perform unpredictably under conditions that
require a good understanding of language ambiguity and nuance.

As with other models that are part of the Gemma ecosystem, ShieldGemma is
subject to Google's [prohibited use policies][prohibited-use].

### Ethical Considerations and Risks

The development of large language models (LLMs) raises several ethical concerns.
We have carefully considered multiple aspects in the development of these
models.

Refer to the [Gemma 3 model card][gemma3-model-card] for more details.

### Benefits

At the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open
large language model implementations designed from the ground up for Responsible
AI development compared to similarly sized models.

Using the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models
have been shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open
model alternatives.
