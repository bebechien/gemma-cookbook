# RecurrentGemma

## RecurrentGemma


RecurrentGemma is an open model based on
[Griffin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427), a hybrid model architecture that
mixes gated linear recurrences with local sliding window attention.


Like Gemma, RecurrentGemma is well-suited for a
variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and
reasoning. However, RecurrentGemma's unique architecture offers the following additional
advantages:

-

  #### Reduced memory usage

  Lower memory requirements allow for the generation of longer samples on devices with limited memory, like single GPUs or CPUs.
-

  #### Higher throughput

  RecurrentGemma can perform inference at significantly higher batch sizes, meaning it can generate substantially more tokens per second --- especially when generating long sequences.
-

  #### High performance

  RecurrentGemma matches Gemma's performance while requiring less memory and achieving faster inference.
