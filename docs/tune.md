# Gemma model fine-tuning

Fine-tuning a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model such as
Gemma modifies the behavior of the model. You typically fine-tune Gemma with the
intent of improving its performance on a specific task or domain, or to better
fulfill a role, such as customer service. Gemma models are released with open
weights, which means you can modify those weights, which then changes the
behavior of the model. The general steps for fine-tuning a Gemma model are as
follows:

-   [Choose a framework](tune#choose-a-framework)
-   [Collect data](tune#collect-data)
-   [Tune and test the model](tune#tune-and-test-the-model)
-   [Deploy the model](tune#deploy-the-model)

## Choose a framework

Gemma models are compatible with a variety of AI tuning frameworks. Each
framework offers various advantages and is typically constrained to a specific
model format. Here are guides for tuning Gemma models with various frameworks:

Note: The JAX fine-tuning guide has been replaced by the
[Gemma library fine-tuning](https://gemma-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/colab_sampling.html)
guide.

Make sure your intended deployment model format, such as Keras format,
Safetensors, or GGUF, is supported as an output by your chosen framework.

## Collect data

Model tuning requires data. Tuning data typically consists of pairs of input
data with the expected response. There are many public datasets available online
for training on various tasks or output. For example, if you wanted to train a
Gemma model to translate car part descriptions to part numbers, your dataset
might include the following:

```python
training_data = [
  {"input_text": "Part number for A4 brake caliper", "output_text": "4M0615107BS"},
  {"input_text": "Part number for Beetle fuel pump", "output_text": "6A127026H"},
  {"input_text": "Part number for Camaro cylinder head", "output_text": "12711770"},
]
```

If you want a Gemma model to perform a specific set of tasks or role, you
typically need to compile a dataset demonstrating multiple variations of that
task. How much data you need to tune a model depends on your goals, particularly
how much of a behavioral change you want from the model and how well you want
the model to perform based on the task to be accomplished and the level of
variation in the input data.

In general, you should start with a small set of data for your task tuning,
adjust training parameters, and add data until you achieve the task performance
that meets your needs. Some of our example applications show that you can
influence the behavior of a Gemma model with as few as 20 prompt and response
pairs. For more details, see
[Build a business email AI assistant with Gemma](/business-email-assistant)
and
[Tasks in spoken languages with Gemma](/spoken-language/task-specific-tuning).

## Tune and test the model

Once you have a tuning framework and tuning data in place, you can begin the
Gemma model tuning process. When performing tuning, you have some options in how
you tune which affects the resources you need to complete it. You also should
have a testing plan for your tuned model to evaluate if it is performing the way
you want it to after tuning.

### Parameter-efficient tuning

When fine-tuning an open weights model such as Gemma, you have the option to
[tune all the parameters the model](/core/huggingface_text_full_finetune)
or use a less resource intensive parameter efficient tuning technique which
updates a subset of them. A *full* tuning approach means that as you apply your
tuning data, you calculate new weights for all parameters of the model. This
approach is compute intensive and memory intensive, since you are performing
these calculations for billions of parameters. Using less resource intensive
tuning approaches, called *parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)*, including
techniques like Low Rank Adapter (LoRA) tuning can produce similar results with
less compute resources. For details on how to perform tuning with less resources
using LoRA, see [Fine-tune Gemma models in Keras using
LoRA](/gemma/docs/lora_tuning) and [Fine-Tuning Gemma Models in Hugging
Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma-peft).

### Testing tuned models

Once you have tuned a model for a specific task you should test its performance
against the set of tasks you want it to perform. You should test your model with
tasks or requests that it was not specifically trained on. How you test your
tuned model depends on the task you want it to perform and how closely you
manage the inputs and outputs for the model. A common way to manage generative
model testing is to use success, failure, and borderline cases:

-   **Success tests**: Requests that the tuned model should always be able
    to perform successfully.
-   **Failure tests**: Requests that the tuned model should always not be
    able to perform, or explicitly refuse to perform, if requested.
-   **Boundary tests**: Requests that the tuned model should be able to
    perform, if they fall within a defined boundary, or set of boundaries, of
    acceptable output behavior.

When testing failure or boundary conditions for your generative AI application,
you should also apply generative AI safety approaches, techniques, and tools as
described in the [Responsible Generative AI Toolkit](https://ai.google.dev/responsible).

## Deploy the model

After completing your tuning and successful completion of your testing, it's
time to deploy your model. You can typically refer to the documentation for your
[chosen framework](tune#choose-a-framework) for how to deploy a tuned
model.

If you are deploying a model with LoRA tuned weights, note that with this
technique you typically deploy *both* the original model and its weights with
the LoRA weights as an additional calculation layer for the model.
