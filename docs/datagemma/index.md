# DataGemma

DataGemma is a research tool that lets users ask questions in plain language and receive answers based on publicly available statistical data in the [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) repository. The tool uses specially built versions of [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core), the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) with Gemini 1.5 Pro, and a set of libraries
specifically designed to work with Data Commons.

This research tool provides two separate techniques for answering questions based on Data Commons statistical data:

- **Retrieval-Interleaved Generation (RIG)** - This approach uses a variant of Gemma 2 that is fine-tuned to recognize when it needs to replace a generated number with more accurate information from Data Commons. For more details, see the Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/datacommonsorg/llm-tools/blob/main/notebooks/datagemma_rig.ipynb) and models on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/datagemma-rig) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/datagemma-rig-27b-it).
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - This approach uses a variant of Gemma 2 that retrieves relevant information from Data Commons and then uses that information to create an extended prompt for the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. For more details, see the Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/datacommonsorg/llm-tools/blob/main/notebooks/datagemma_rag.ipynb) and models on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/datagemma-rag) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/datagemma-rag-27b-it).
